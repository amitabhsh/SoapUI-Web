SoapUI-Web is a Generic SOAP Client written in Jquery only.

Since this is Javascript only, most browsers will not allow direct access to SOAP based web services (CROSS Domain Policy),
I have included a small Java Servlet which will work as proxy for all GET and POST Requests. To use, deploy the war file and access index.html.

Alternatively you can use the SoapUI.html, which works without any proxy class. 
To use this in chrome for testing purposes only, use  --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security flags to open chrome. This is not recommended.
